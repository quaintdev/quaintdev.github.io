      <description>Ditch the feed. RSS is all you need</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/ditch-feed.jpg" alt="AI generate image of boy holding the sign that says &amp;ldquo;ditch the feed. RSS is all you need&amp;rdquo;"  title="AI generated image"  />
</p>
<p>Gone are the days when you could just find a random blog on Internet where someone wrote about tinkering with their home lab or someone shared about the obscure art they know. Today&rsquo;s web is highly curated and everything is filtered out to show you the content that would generate most revenue. Search engines are filled with optimized results that can easily be categorized as spam. And social media is filled with highly polished, attractive content that may not add any value at all to an individuals life.</p>
<p>I blame Ads. The web has become increasingly hostile place because of ads. Huge corporations are pouring billions to grab eyeballs on the web. The ads are becoming intrusive and there are third party trackers everywhere. Trackers that track your interests and show you ads depending on that.  Using web without an adblocker is a nightmare. Now it&rsquo;s getting difficult to block ads as well <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Then there&rsquo;s case of AI generated content which is only going to increase and it will become increasingly difficult to discern from real content.</p>
<h2 id="ditch-the-feed">Ditch The Feed</h2>
<p>I mostly hang out on Hacker News and Reddit. I don&rsquo;t have any other social media and I have found myself worrying about global politics, climate change, microplastics and whole lot of other things. Things that I have no control over. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong it&rsquo;s good to be informed about these things but constant influx of such information is not helping anyone. It&rsquo;s critical to regulate what we consume on web because our brains have a tendency to think about what we consume. Our very thoughts could be the result of what information we are consuming. Seriously ditch the feed that someone else is curating for you! <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="curate-your-own">Curate Your Own</h2>
<p>After all issues above one might want to ditch all the social media and web along with it but we all know that&rsquo;s not possible. The best we can do is limit the influx of information and curate it such that it&rsquo;s good for our well being. Find people and organizations you can trust. There are bloggers and content creators who know their craft and audience. These are the once who prefer authenticity over anything else. You will never see AI generated content from these <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. You can also trust their content. Subscribe to such people and organizations. Add them to your feed or remove them if they aren&rsquo;t adding any value to your life. Curate your own feed religiously.</p>
<p>But how?  Enters RSS.</p>
<h2 id="introdution-to-rss">Introdution to RSS</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a social media feed but you are the curator. You choose sources that will appear in your feed and not some algorithm which is prioritizing revenue of some corporation over your interests. There are no trackers or intrusive ads in RSS. You can configure how frequently you want to refresh the feed. You choose the application to browse the feed. Unlike web where you only have Chrome or Firefox for browsing, RSS feeds can be read on any of 1000s of clients available. Choose one that suits you I will recommend <a href="https://github.com/prof18/feed-flow">Feed flow</a>. You can even use browser to read your feed. I am using miniflux and this is how my feed looks like:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/miniflux.png" alt="RSS feed curated with miniflux"  />
</p>
<p>A Word of Advice: limit the number of sources and frequency of refresh. That way you will have the best possible experience browsing the web. Once you become accustomed to RSS you can configure it to consume everything from blogs to YouTube videos and even podcasts. Your RSS feed should be a place where you can find information that you are interested in. Unlike social media, RSS feed will get boring fast and hence non addictive. You will spend less time on web and more time with yourself.</p>
<p>One more thing, sometimes websites do not provide RSS feed and in that case there&rsquo;s nothing we can do except request them to provide one. But such sites are limited and most websites will provide RSS feed. For example, you can subscribe to this blog by clicking on RSS icon below:</p>
<p><a href="https://rohanrd.xyz/index.xml"><img loading="lazy" src="/static/rss.svg" alt=""  />
</a></p>
<p>Next time you want to subscribe to anyone just look for above icon. Happy curating!</p>

<p>As much as I had like to avoid entire social media it still has some value so I have limited Reddit and Hacker news to once a week. It&rsquo;s still new so I will see how it goes.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I am not against using AI generated content. It has it&rsquo;s place but it should be clearly marked as such.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

      <title>Why Start Self Hosting</title>

      <description>Take control back of your digital life</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember Picasa? There is no native application even today that comes close to it&rsquo;s feature parity. But sadly it was discontinued in favour of a cloud application: Google Photos. What happened with Picasa also happened to millions of other applications around the same time Picasa was discontinued. The applications we use to run on our PC have moved to cloud. It makes sense from corporations perspective because they get more control over updates, user data and licenses but users are at huge disadavantage as they no longer are in control of their own data. You might ask why that is such an issue? Let&rsquo;s see:</p>
<p>Consider this, you carefully curate your playlists on Spotify but every now and then you see a certain song missing from your playlist. Same goes for videos saved in your YouTube playlists or other music/video streaming services. Then there is also the case of OTT streaming platforms where the show you were going to watch over weekend has now disappeared. If this was not bad imagine what happens when you need document from your email but the provider has suspended your account because of something you did (which was not even violation of terms of service) on other service of that email provider. <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=account+suspended">Hacker News is littered with such stories</a>. There are some stories where the user never figured out what they had done wrong to deserve suspension of account.</p>
<p>Then there is this whole different problem of corporations tracking you and your data. Whenever I bring this up people are like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, I have nothing to hide&rdquo;. But this is exactly similiar to saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about free speech because I have nothing to say&rdquo;. Would you give up your right to free speech because you have nothing to say? No. The same goes about right to privacy. The data you share is used to cater you personalized ads. That same data is also used to ensure that you spend maximum time with the particular service. There are millions of engineers across the world who are getting paid hefty sum to keep as many eyeballs as possible glued to service offered by their employers. This engineering talent is supposed to be solving world&rsquo;s problems but instead they are ensuring how everyone wastes their time. That&rsquo;s a whole different topic for another blog post.</p>
<p>What self hosting does is it protects you against all these issues and more. It gives you the peace of mind by keeping you in control of your data. You can choose if you never want your data to leave your premises or home. You can also choose to make your data available to you whenever or wherever you want it securely. In upcoming posts, we will explore self hosted applications and how they protect you and your data. But if you cannot wait, head over to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted">r/selfhosted</a> or check out this <a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted/blob/master/README.md">awesome self hosted list</a> to get started with your self hosting journey.</p>
